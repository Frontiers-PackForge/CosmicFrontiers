## Cosmic Frontiers is a 1.20.1 mod pack centered around Gregtech Community Edition Modern and the interactions of many mods with plenty of custom content.

### Heavily Inspired by 1.12.2 Modpacks such as

* Technological Journey - I'm one of TJ's Devs as well lol
* NomiFactory Ceu
* FTB Interactions
* SuperSymmetry

### What to expect playing Cosmic Frontiers
1. An in-depth quest book to help you along your way
2. Plenty of Worldgen overhauls to make each world feel alive and varied
3. Dimensional Travel to the Stars and the Depths deep below
4. A gradient of difficulty in all aspects, from survival to combat to recipes and more.
5. A rich atmospheric experience with the use of Shaders and many quality-enhancing mods
6. Intertwining Many Non-Gregtech Mods Into Gregtech in their own ways - or designing new GT content based on other mods
7. Manage Sanity, Heat, and your wits to withstand the horrors trapped within your universe.
8. Level up your Gear and Yourself with Skills and Apotheosis
9. A background narrative to help you feel the carefully built universe of Frontiers.
