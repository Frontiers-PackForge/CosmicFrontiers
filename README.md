## Tired of GregTech Modpacks all doing the same thing? Want to have a splash of magic and utter nonsense thrown into your gameplay without needing a PHD in chemistry? 
### Well let's go kill Space Jeff Bezos. [In Minecraft, my lawyers have informed me I must legally say this]

## What are you getting yourself into?

 Gonna be honest I suck at writing descriptions. Who would have guessed. So like yeah.

Go progress through 15 Voltage Tiers of Gregtech and 17 Technology Ages, with the goal of seeing your plots of revenge through. 
This pack come 1.0.0 will feature a fully written narrative you can enjoy within the confines of the questbook, even changing the ending of the pack based on your choices.

As your complemtary sarcastic DM, I'll be guiding you along, nice to meet you. Please refrain from eating your circuits ***even if they are edible***. 

What do you mean eating the circuit gave you creative flight stop that.

I'm not paid enough for this.

# What To expect, With images for the tiktok brains among us (sus)

### 2. **Entirely** Overhauled Gregtech progression, Mixing Themes of Magic and Other nonsense together to make an unforgetable experience.

## 5. Custom Shader Support Via "CosmicBliss" - A Modified Version of Bliss Shaders with the goal of enabling colored lighting for everything in frontiers (With More shaders to come with support eventually)

I ran out of images, want some snacks? The rest is below.

6. A gradient of difficulty in all aspects while not being too punishing. Set out and acquire positive food buffs, player upgrades, and gear to let you survive this hostile world.
7. A rich atmospheric experience with the use of Shaders and many quality-enhancing mods
8. Intertwining Many Non-Gregtech Mods Into Gregtech in their own ways - or designing new GT content based on other mods
9. A background narrative to help you feel the carefully built universe of Frontiers.
