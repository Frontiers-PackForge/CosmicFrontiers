// Infinity Chain
// LUV | 8 Potential Catalyst + Naquahine Charge = 1152 False Infinity
// LUV | 576mb False Infinity + 576mb Res.Virtue = 576mb impractical Infinity
// ZPM | 288mb Impractical Infinity + 288mb Refined Quantum Star Slurry = 288mb Suitable Infinity
// ZPM | 288mb Suitable Infinity + 8 Singularities (AE2) + 50,000LP = 144 Logical Infinity

//Dev Notes : Logical Infinity is the Mainstay material fo whatever tier this is, i think it's uh
// Res Virtue : Late IV
// Naq Supercompound : Late LuV
// Trinavine : Mid ZPM
// Living Igniclad : UV

// Probably somewhere between Trinavine and Igniclad as it also wraps up into Programmable Matter later on once the Neutron Forge is more appropriate
// to introduce into progression
// also before you write the recipes you dumbfuck finish IV so you can get out of your dev rut.

// Programmable Matter Base Line WIP - This will be a later step gated by stronger Naquahine Explosive catalysts and UHV
// 16x Logical Infinity + Naquahine Energized Blast Charge = 8x Programmable Matter Base
