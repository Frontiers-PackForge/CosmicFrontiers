  Mage Bloom and Ethanol both come from various Flora Nurturer Loops. Both Use Nether Sediment as their nutrient base 
  
  AUX STEP : WASTE WATER UUUUH UUUUH WHAT MACHINE AUUUUGH?????
  10000MB of Organic Waste Water => 10000MB Water + 30x Bio Chaff
  
  STEP ONE : CHEM BATH
  Water 1000MB + 4 Mage Blooms => 4 Washed Bloom Petals + 1000 Organic Waste Waster 

  STEP TWO : CHEMICAL REACTOR @ MV
  500MB of Piranha Solution  + 1500MB H2O + 4 Washed Bloom Petals => Source Leeched Solution 2000 + 25% for Bio Chaff 1x + 50% chance for Bio Chaff 1x

  
  STEP THREE : CHEMICAL DEHYDRATOR
  3000 Source Leeched Solution + ??? => 1000MB of I'll do the rest Later -Ghost This Evening
