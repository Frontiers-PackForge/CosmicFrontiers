    # The protection damage reduction formula.
    # Computed after Prot Pierce and Prot Shred are applied.
    # Arguments:
    #     'protPoints' - The number of protection points the user has after reductions.
    # Output:
    #     The percentage of damage taken after protection has been applied, from 0 (no damage taken) to 1 (full damage taken).
    # Reference:
    #     See https://github.com/ezylang/EvalEx#usage-examples for how to write expressions.

    # The a-value formula, which computes an intermediate used in the armor formula.
    # Arguments:
    #     'damage' - The damage of the incoming attack.
    # Output:
    #     The a-value, which will be supplied as an argument to the armor formula.
    # Reference:
    #     See https://github.com/ezylang/EvalEx#usage-examples for how to write expressions.

    # Computed after Armor Pierce and Armor Shred are applied.
    # Arguments:
    #     'a' - The a-value computed by the a-value formula.
    #     'damage' - The damage of the incoming attack.
    #     'armor' - The armor value of the user after reductions.
    # Output:
    #     The percentage of damage taken after armor has been applied, from 0 (no damage taken) to 1 (full damage taken).
    # Reference:
    #     See https://github.com/ezylang/EvalEx#usage-examples for how to write expressions.
